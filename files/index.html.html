<h1>Hey Beautiful… ✨</h1>
<p>It has been a long time! I hope you're well.</p>
<p>This project of mine is dedicated to my beautiful girl,<br><strong>Mrs. Shista Thakuri Shrestha</strong></p>
<p>Well, let’s get to the point!</p>

     alt="old.photo">
<p><strong>Let’s start with Day 1.</strong></p>
<p>We were both very young around the time we met. We were only 10 years old.</p>
<p>But even at such a young age, we both committed to this relationship.</p>
<p>We had an amazing start to our journey, and I didn’t realize it until now.</p>
<p>You made me the luckiest man in the world back in Class 5.</p>
<p>With YOU by my side, I felt that I could achieve anything.</p>

<h1>My Happiest Memories</h1>
<p>My childhood was so much better with you in it.</p>
<p>I enjoyed each and every moment and just wished time would freeze at those moments.</p>
<p>We were quite the opposites of each other.</p>
<p>You were an extroverted, confident, and beautiful young lady willing to do anything to achieve her dreams, whereas I was a shy and silent young boy.</p>
<p>But even with all our differences, like the famous quote goes, “Opposites attract.”</p>
<p>The universe pulled <strong>US</strong> together.</p>
<p>I lacked confidence and structure, but you became the very foundation of my hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>You pushed me past my comfort zone and made me realize my true potential and abilities.</p>
<p>With you by my side, I felt as though I was <strong>INVINCIBLE.</strong></p>

<h1>Ups and Downs</h1>
<p>Relationships are not perfect from the beginning.</p>
<p>Every relationship has its own ups and downs.</p>
<p>So I will say it honestly — ours wasn’t perfect.</p>
<p>We were young and immature. We didn’t know the proper way to express our feelings, which led to many misunderstandings that slowly chipped away at our relationship.</p>
<p>I couldn’t realize the grave mistakes I was making.</p>
<p>You are a truly brave young lady who put aside her own happiness to please me.</p>
<p>I am forever grateful that you stayed by my side even when I hurt you during arguments.</p>
<p>Let me properly and formally apologize.</p>
<p><strong>I am sorry you felt that way, and I am truly sorry for hurting you.</strong></p>

<h1>Reality</h1>

</div>
<p>You said you lost feelings way back, but I don’t think that’s true.</p>
<p>You can’t deny there was love and happiness behind those messages.</p>
<p>I took these screenshots when I felt really happy or loved something you said, so I could read them again and smile.</p>
<p>Just the simple message “My Man” really meant a lot to me.</p>
<p>So when you look at our relationship, don’t just look at the quarrels and fights.</p>
<p>Don’t let one or two bad memories ruin all the times we were truly happy and loved each other dearly.</p>
<p>Even if you feel the spark is gone, we can reignite it once again.</p>
<p>We did it once — we can do it again.</p>
<p>Just give <strong>US</strong> a second chance.</p>
<p>We are young and have plenty of time to grow together.</p>

<div class="container" id="page6">
<h1>The Truth</h1>
<p>I was young, stupid, and immature, and I didn’t realize it until it was too late.</p>
<p>But during the time we’ve been apart, I started working on myself.</p>
<p>I have changed and I am still trying to better myself for the future us.</p>
<p>I once was the happiest man in the world who lost a one-in-a-billion type of girl.</p>
<p>So I am improving myself so that when the time comes, I don’t mess it up again.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t believe me, just look at my growth yourself.</p>
<p>There were times I felt very sad and thought about giving up.</p>
<p>But I didn’t lose sight of the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I realized, after you left, how much I loved you, how much I needed you, and how much I wanted you.</p>
<button class="btn" onclick="nextPage('page7')">Next</button>

<!-- PAGE 7 -->
<div class="container" id="page7">
<h1>Realization</h1>
<p>I was able to focus on my career and my path ahead because I knew there was someone waiting for me.</p>
<p>That gave me every bit of motivation I needed.</p>
<p>I will forever be grateful for you.</p>
<p>I told you I would do anything to get you back because how can I lose such an amazing girl?</p>
<p>I am still holding onto the promise I made to you in Class 6 on Promise Day.</p>
<p>I want to build a future with you.</p>
<p>You promised me a family — remember?</p>
<p>You talked about “Our Little Ones.”</p>
<p>So believe me when I say I have changed and am still improving myself.</p>
<p>For you. For us. For our future ahead.</p>
